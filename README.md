## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Wayland (GNOME/Fedora)
This tool requires **X11** to function.  
**Option 1 (recommended):**
1. Log out of GNOME  
2. At login screen ‚Üí click ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí select **‚ÄúGNOME on Xorg‚Äù**  
3. Log in and run the script

**Option 2:** Force X11 backend  
```bash
GDK_BACKEND=x11 ./eve_preview_enhanced.py
```

Check your session type:
```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE  # should show "x11"
```

### Common Issues

**Thumbnails not appearing**
- Verify you‚Äôre on X11 (`echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`)
- Ensure EVE clients are running (`ps aux | grep exefile`)
- Check window titles start with `EVE - `

**Steam clients not detected**
- The script looks for `exefile.exe` in process list

**Black thumbnails**
- Disable compositing in your DE
- Ensure Mesa/AMDGPU drivers are updated
- Try lower FPS (10 FPS recommended)

**SELinux (Fedora/RHEL)**
```bash
getenforce
sudo setenforce 0   # test in permissive mode
```
If this fixes it, create a custom policy or permanently disable enforcement for this script.

```

---

## üìù Known Issues
- Wayland: not supported (use X11 session)
- Some compositors may show black thumbnails
- High DPI scaling may need manual adjustment
- Multi-monitor setups default thumbnails to primary screen

---

## üéÆ Performance Notes

**Recommended Settings**
- Refresh rate: 10 FPS (smooth & light)
- Thumbnail size: 320√ó200
- Opacity: 0.95

**High-end systems (e.g. Ryzen 7 5800X + RX 7900 XTX)**  
Use 15‚Äì25 FPS and larger thumbnails (400√ó250+) for smoother display.

**Low-end systems**
- 10 FPS  
- Smaller thumbnails (280√ó175)  
- Disable zoom on hover

##üß† Future Move to PipeWire

I‚Äôm not a professional coder ‚Äî just a Linux tinkerer still learning and experimenting.
This project is a personal passion project that keeps evolving as I discover new tools and APIs.

A long-term goal for Fedora 43+ is to explore PipeWire‚Äôs window capture and frame-sharing APIs as a potential enhancement.
The goal is to:

Capture frames from running EVE Online clients more efficiently

Potentially bypass focus-related throttling for smoother thumbnails

Add Wayland session support without depending on X11

This feature will be tested first on Fedora 43 with PipeWire 1.2+ once the new API stabilizes.
If successful, it should bring smoother performance and better Wayland compatibility ‚Äî a big step forward for Linux multiboxers on modern desktops.
