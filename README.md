üöÄ Usage
Basic Usage

Start your EVE Online clients (Steam or native)
Run the script: ./eve_preview_enhanced.py
Thumbnails will appear automatically for each client

Controls

Left Click: Focus/activate the client
Left Drag: Move thumbnail (drag threshold to prevent accidental moves)
Right Drag: Alternative way to move thumbnail
Ctrl + Left Click: Minimize the client
Mouse Hover: Zoom thumbnail (if enabled)

Settings
Click the settings icon in the main window to customize:

Display: Thumbnail size (100-800px), opacity (0.2-1.0), active border color
Behavior: Always on top, hide active client, show character overlay
Interaction: Zoom on hover (1.1x-2.0x zoom factor)
Performance: Refresh rate (10/15/25 FPS)

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Settings are stored in: ~/.config/eve-o-preview-linux/config.json
You can manually edit this file or use the built-in settings dialog.
Default configuration:
json{
  "thumbnail_width": 320,
  "thumbnail_height": 200,
  "opacity": 0.95,
  "always_on_top": true,
  "hide_active_client": false,
  "zoom_on_hover": true,
  "zoom_factor": 1.25,
  "show_overlay": true,
  "refresh_fps": 10,
  "active_border_color": "#00FF00",
  "thumbnail_positions": {}
}
üêõ Troubleshooting
Running on Wayland (GNOME/Fedora users)
The script requires X11 to function. If you're running Wayland (default on modern Fedora/GNOME):
Option 1: Use X11 session (Recommended)

Log out of GNOME
At the login screen, click the gear icon
Select "GNOME on Xorg"
Log in and run the script

Option 2: Force GDK to use X11 backend
The script automatically sets GDK_BACKEND=x11, but you can also run:
bashGDK_BACKEND=x11 ./eve_preview_enhanced.py
To verify your session type:
bashecho $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
# Should show "x11" for the script to work properly
Thumbnails not appearing

Ensure you're running X11 (not Wayland): echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
Verify EVE clients are running (not just the launcher)
Check that window titles start with "EVE - " (character name)

Steam clients not detected

The script looks for "exefile.exe" in process command line
Ensure EVE is running, not just the launcher
Check process list: ps aux | grep exefile

Performance issues

Lower the refresh rate in settings (10 FPS recommended)
Reduce thumbnail size (320x200 is optimal)
Check CPU usage with htop or top
AMD users: Ensure AMDGPU drivers are properly installed

Thumbnails showing black screen

This can happen with some graphics drivers or compositing managers
Try disabling compositing in your DE settings
For AMD GPUs: Ensure Mesa drivers are up to date
Try different refresh rates in settings

SELinux issues (Fedora/RHEL)
If you encounter permission errors:
bash# Check SELinux status
getenforce

# Temporarily set to permissive for testing
sudo setenforce 0

# If this fixes it, create a custom policy or disable for this script

Development Setup
bashgit clone https://github.com/arsin305/eve-o-preview-linux.git
cd eve-o-preview-linux
./eve_preview_enhanced.py

üìù Known Issues

Wayland: Not supported due to security restrictions. Use X11 session.
Some DEs: Compositing managers may cause black thumbnails
High DPI: Scaling may need manual adjustment in settings
Multi-monitor: Thumbnails default to primary monitor

üéÆ Performance Notes

Recommended Settings

Refresh Rate: 10 FPS (good balance of smoothness and CPU usage)
Thumbnail Size: 320x200 (optimal for most displays)
Opacity: 0.95 (minimal transparency for best performance)

High-end Systems
If you have a powerful system (like the tested configuration with Ryzen 7 5800X and RX 7900 XTX):

You can safely use 15-25 FPS for smoother thumbnails
Larger thumbnail sizes (400x250+) work well
Enable zoom on hover without performance concerns

Lower-end Systems

Use 10 FPS
Smaller thumbnails (280x175)
Disable zoom on hover
Reduce opacity slightly

**What This Tool Does:**

EVE-O Preview is a passive observation tool that creates visual thumbnails of your EVE Online client windows. It does not:
- Modify game files or memory
- Inject code into the game client
- Automate any gameplay actions
- Provide unfair advantages beyond basic window management
- Send or intercept network traffic

This tool serves the same function as the Windows version of EVE-O Preview, adapted for Linux users.
